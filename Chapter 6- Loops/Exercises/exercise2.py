# Exercise 2: Movie Tickets

'''A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket'''

prompt = "\nHow old are you ?"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' when you are finished: "

while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    age = int(age)
    if age < 3:
        print("Your movie ticket is FREE.")
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        print("Ticket Cost: $10.00")
    else:
        if age > 12:
             print("Ticket Cost: $15.00")
            
    if age == 'quit':
        break
