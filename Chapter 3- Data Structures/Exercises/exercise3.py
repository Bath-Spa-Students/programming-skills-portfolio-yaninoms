 # Exercise 3: Your Own List 
'''Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car,
 and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements
   about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”'''
 

#  List of favorite mode of transportation
fav_transpo = ['public bus', 'metro', 'car']

# Statements about the mode of transportation
print(f"I used to commute for school through the AUH {fav_transpo[0]}.")
print(f"I have barely experienced Dubai's {fav_transpo[1]}.")
print(f"I want to own a Defender {fav_transpo[2]}.")
