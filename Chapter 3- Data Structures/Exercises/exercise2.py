## Exercise 2: Greetings 
'''Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just

printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be

personalized with the person’s name.'''

# The names
names = ['Mc', 'Vernan','Jhunnie']

# Printing the names with the same message
print(f"How are you, {names[0]} ?")
print(f"How are you, {names[1]} ?")
print(f"How are you, {names[2]} ?")
