# Exercise 5 : Favorite Fruits
'''Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent 
if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
•Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
•Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. 
If the fruit is in your list, the if block
should print a statement,such as You really like bananas!'''
